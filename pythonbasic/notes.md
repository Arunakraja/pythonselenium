# Selenium Features:
* Selenium is an open source Automation testing tool.
* It is exclusive web based automation tool.
* Types of Applications.
1. Standalone Application/ Desktop application-> file format of .exe Ex: Notepad, Worddocument, Excel document
2. Client server Application-> One part of the application will be installed in client and another part of application is installed in server.  Ex: Skype, MS teams
3. Web based application. Any application if trying to access using the URL.

   4. Ruby
   5. Javascript

# Instructions for setting up python and selenium
· Install python.exe from their official website
	https://www.python.org/downloads/
· Make sure you note Python installation path in your machine
· Set Python home in system variables
	C:\Users\karthikb\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32
	C:\Users\karthikb\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Scripts
* Add to environment variable in your system.
· Check if python is successfully installed
Python –version.

# Python IDLE (Integrated Developmenet and learning environment )
* This IDLE is simple REPL Tool.
* R-> Read
* E-> Evolve
* P-> Print
* l-> Loop
* For learning purpose we can use python repl tool called IDLE.
* This is not meant for big application and production code.
* Similar to python shell called IDLE, in java we have jshell which came in the java version java9 
* In swift programming language we have playgorund shell for the beginners to play with syntax and small programs.

# What is PIP?
* Pip is package management system used to install and manage software packages written in python 
* PIP is a recursive acronym that can stand for pip instals package, or pip installs python 
* In javascript we have npm.

# What is selenium ?
* Selenium is a library.

What is a library
library is a collection of code working for a common cause.

# Python Data Types:
* Number Data
* String Data *widely used in the real time*
* List
* Tuple
* Dictionary

* Python number data type is used to hold numeric values like, int, float, complex.
Ex: a= 100, b= 10.2345, c = 100+3j

* Before Python version 3, we had version 2.x in this 2.x version many changes were introduced.
* Long data type: This long data type exists in python version 2.0 and deprecated in python version 3.0.


# Python String Data type:
* A string is a sequence of characters.
* Python supports Unicode of characters.
* Strings are represented by either single or double quotes.

'sadadhasd'-> String
"123712asdksadgas"-> String

# Collection related Data Type.
* List
* Tuple
* Dictionary 

* Collection related Data Type means holding multiple values at a given point of time.

# List Data Type.
* List data type is represented by square brackets and each value is seperated by comma's.

# In list data type what are the operation did we see:
1. We saw how to insert a value
2. How to append a value to the end of the list
3. How to update a new value in the list


# Tuple Data Type:
Collection related data type means holding multiple values at a given point of time

* Tuple is another data type in python.
* Tuple is immutable in nature (which means once created no more changes allowed)
* That means data in tuple is write protected.
* Tuple is represented using simple bracket or parenthesis and each value seperated by commas.


# Dictionary Data Type:
* In dictionary we have keyword and the value.
* Dictionary is similar to hash table type.
* Dictionary are written within curly braces in the form of key: value pair
* It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among large amount of data.

# Flow control in python
